SMART Error Log Version: 1
ATA Error Count: 22 (device log contains only the most recent five errors)

Powered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as
DDd+hh:mm:SS.sss where DD=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes,
SS=sec, and sss=millisec. It "wraps" after 49.710 days.

Error 22 occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 26834 hours (1118 days + 2 hours)
